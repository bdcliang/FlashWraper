# FlashWraper 
As its name ,It's just  a short wraper for shockwaveflash,for easy use,target for .NET 2.0
It includes some common methods which can be esaily used when we introduced the ShockwaveFlash
to our .NET solutions
as for not referencing so much assemblies,I pack the COM assembly into one.


usage:
at the designer window, drag the assembly FlashWraper.dll into the toolbars ,then you can see the FlashWraper controls
just in list,and you can use it as other Mircro provided controls.
